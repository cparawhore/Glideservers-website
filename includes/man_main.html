        <h3>What is Maintenance Mode?</h3>
        <p>When this mode is active, it means that we are improving the quality of our services in one way or another.
        <p>Furthermore, all services should stay online and active, you just wont be able to access our client area temporarily. (If you have a VPS service with us, you can still access it through the separate control panel)
        <p>Above, under the page title, there should be an estimated time of when the client area should be back online, please press the "Try Again" button for updates on this page, it will redirect you to the client area if maintenance mode is disabled.</p>
